Text-Tidx version 0.91
======================

Text:Tidx allows you to index any text file using key fields
start-stop coordinates, and, later, use that index for binary-search 
lookups into the file, even though there is a range of responses.

This was written because it was, for me significantly faster, for very large 
files (>100k rows) and many searches ( > 10k), then entering 
all of the information into a database and doing range querys, 
even faster than SQLITE's rtree extension, or the "tabix" program
both of which are do similar things and do them rather well.

Although it was designed for chromosome, stop, start indexing, 
it is not genome specific, and can index any delimited text file.

Indexes are loaded into RAM.  If you only have a few lookups
to do perl instance, this is expensive, and a database will be faster.
